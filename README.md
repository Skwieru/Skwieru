- 👋 Hi, I’m @Skwieru...
	My name is Marcin, I'm a novice programmer. I'm 24 years old and I'm from Poland. I've started my programming adventure with JAVA course on UDEMY half year ago.
	I've wanted to try myself in backend and frontend to see which one is suits me better. JAVA was fun ,but I've found myself much better in JavaScript.
	I'm really creative person so making animations, website designs and using my brain for creating all of these things just makes me feel happy.
	For this moment it's just my hobby. I wanna make it my full-time job in the future, because working in something I enjoy is my life goal.
	For now I've learned:
	- HTML / HTML 5
	- CSS / CSS 5
	- JQUERY
	- JAVA SCRIPT
	I'm still practicing Java Script, because I want to know bacics and more advanced technologies of that language as good as it's possible
	so can so I would be able to use frameworks and librarys with understanding exactly how they works.
