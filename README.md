- 👋 Hi, I’m @Skwieru...
	My name is Marcin, I'm a novice programmer. I'm 24 years old and I'm from Poland. I've started my programming adventure with JAVA course on UDEMY one year ago.
	I wanted to try myself in backend and frontend to see which one suits me better. JAVA was fun ,but I've found myself much better in JavaScript.
	I'm really creative person so making animations, website designs and using my brain for creating all of these things just makes me feel happy.
	For this moment it's just my hobby. I wanna make it my full-time job in the future, because working in something I enjoy is my life goal.
	For now I've learned:
	- HTML / HTML 5
	- CSS / CSS 3
	- JQUERY
	- JAVA SCRIPT
	For this moment i'm working with React.
