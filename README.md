- 👋 Hi, I’m @Skwieru...
	My name is Marcin. I'm from Poland and I'm novice programmer. I've started my programing adventure with JAVA course on UDEMY half year ago.
	I wanted to try myself in backend and frontend to see which one is better for me. JAVA was fun but I found myself much better in JavaScript.
	I am really creative person so making animations, website designs and using my brain for creating all of these things just makes me feel happy.
	For this moment it's just my hobby. I wanna make it my full-time job in the future, becouse working in something I enjoy is my life goal.
