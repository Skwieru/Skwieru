- 👋 Hi, I’m @Skwieru...
	My name is Marcin, I'm novice programmer. I'm 24 years old and I'm from Poland. I've started my programing adventure with JAVA course on UDEMY half year ago.
	I wanted to try myself in backend and frontend to see which one is better for me. JAVA was fun but I've found myself much better in JavaScript.
	I am really creative person so making animations, website designs and using my brain for creating all of these things just makes me feel happy.
	For this moment it's just my hobby. I wanna make it my full-time job in the future, becouse working in something I enjoy is my life goal.
	Acctually I've learnd:
	- HTML / HTML 5
	- CSS / CSS 5
	- JQUERY
	- JAVA SCRIPT
	I'm still practicing Java Script, becouse I want to know bacics and more advanced technologies of that language as good as it's possible
	so can so I would be able to use frameworks and librarys with understanding exactly how they works.
